            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE General Queſtion now in Agitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People is, <hi>Who is next Lawful Heir to the Crown?</hi> The Proteſtant ſaith, <hi>The King's Eldeſt Son;</hi> The Papiſt, <hi>a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Heir;</hi> The free Stateſman, <hi>None at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Two incident Queſtions to the General and Principal, are not rightly ſtated; for they are not as they ought to be made, Whether here is a Lawful Marriage, or a Lawful Filiation: But whether there are Witneſſes to prove the Papal and Epiſcopal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a Marriage and a Filiation, which falſe ſtate the Caſe, and are nothing to the purpoſe. But we cannot come to the reſolution, either of the Principal or Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents falſe or true, before the Diſcuſſion of Two other Preparatory Queſtions.</p>

               <item>(1.) By what Law Marriage, Filiation, and Succeſſion ought to be judged Lawful or Unlawful?</item>
               <item>(2.) By what Judge the ſame ought to be judged.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to which I have already proved at large in the Firſt Book, That the ſame ought to be judged by no other Law than the Moral Law of God; And in the Second, That the ſame ought to be judged by no other Judge, than the King and Parliament. To avoid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:99540:3"/>vain Repetitions, I muſt deſire to refer thee to the Firſt and Second Books for thy full Satisfaction; and in this Third, ſhall only from the Two other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes make this Concluſion, That the King's Eldeſt Son is the next undoubted Lawful Heir, both by the Law of God, and of the Land; wherein though I wave the falſe ſtate of the Queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether Ceremony, or no Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? and only inſiſt on the true, Whether Lawful, or Unlawful yet I deſire thou wilt accept theſe following Reaſons for my Excuſe.</p>

            <p>As to the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending:
<list>
                  <item>(1.) Becauſe as to the Matter of Fact, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremony or no Ceremony? I am altogether a Stranger, and know nothing of it; and if I did, yet all Council are Prohibited by the Law to ſpeak to any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact.</item>
                  <item>(2.) This hinders not any others from uſing what Probation they ſhall pleaſe of Ceremonies; but all Advantages of the ſame are hereby to them ſaved by Proteſtation.</item>
                  <item>(3.) This ſeeks not to hinder any from uſing what Ceremonies in their Marriages they pleaſe, which ſuit beſt with their Conſciences and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; only that which is here affirmed, is the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Validity of the Marriages of ſuch with whoſe Conſciences or Conveniences ſuch Ceremonies ſuit not, if they are made without them.</item>
                  <item>(4.) No Liberty of Conſcience, no not ſo much as of Opinion, is hereby precluded any man touching the Point in Queſtion, nor is he hinder'd from oppoſing any thing here deliver'd; but if he differ, is invited to do it; ſo it be in Print with Name ſubſcribed, whereby the ſame Liberty may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Reply.</item>
                  <item>(5.) Becauſe I write to Proteſtants, and only deſire to give Satisfaction to Conſcience concerning Lawful and Unlawful before God, and not to Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:99540:3"/>concerning Ceremony and no Ceremony before the Biſhop.</item>
                  <item>(6.) It were more for the Safety and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Proteſtant Religion, that a Proteſtant Prince either waved his Legitimacy by the Papal and Epiſcopal Ceremonies and Law, or were totally Illegitimated by the ſame, as King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> were, and as they did Claim his Legitimation and Title from the moſt Righteous, Sacred, and Immutable Moral Law of God, and the Law of the Land; and not from Pontifical Laws. To ſpeak next in reference to the Laws by which Marriage and Filiation ought to be judged, which are the Laws of God, and of the Land agreeing with the ſame. I wave inſiſting on Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<list>
                        <item>(1.) Becauſe thoſe Laws Civil or Canon, of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Popes, Biſhops, Synods, or Councils of <hi>Trent,</hi> or other Councils which Impoſe Ceremonies on Marriage, are neither the Laws of God, nor of the Land; but Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as I have already proved at large, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>Et Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>Et Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 182, 183.</item>
                        <item>(2.) To ſet any value on the Ceremonies of thoſe Laws were to give the Supremacy of the King and Parliament, and the Laws enacted by them concerning Marriage, Filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Succeſſion to Popes and Biſhops, and their Canons; and thereby to give them power to Depoſe Kings, and give or ſell the Succeſſions of Kingdoms to whom they pleaſe.</item>
                        <item>(3.) It is cleerly and unanſwerably proved in the following Diſcourſe, That the Marriage now under conſideration, was a Lawful, Holy, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble Marriage by the Moral Law of God, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared both in Nature and Scripture.</item>

            <p>To bring a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law therefore where the Moral is ſo clear, were to bring a Candle to give light to the Sun.

            </p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, Fame and Reputation, which are <hi>Voces &amp; opinio Vulgi,</hi> are an uſual Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marriage. As to the Second, The Cannon Law it ſelf <hi>Jus Pontificium praeſumit ex diuturna Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione filium eſſe Legitimum,</hi> Craig. Feud. 270. Cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for any time is ſo high a Preſumption of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb facs="tcp:99540:4"/>as it Legitimates the Son. And amongſt the Old <hi>Romans,</hi> one of their chief ways of Lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, without Ceremony of Prieſt or Temple was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus,</hi> that is Cohabitation and Conjugal Society for the ſpace of a year, and this was reputed ſo conſiderable a time, as it made a Marriage by Preſcription. As to the Third, which is where there is no Lawful Impediment, nor the Parties are prohibited by the Law of God to Marry, this makes a preſumption of Marriage; becauſe it was no Sin for them by the Law of God to Marry. As to the Fourth cauſe of Preſumption, which is Chaſtity and Children, where all the Circumſtances concur of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marriage as Cohabitation, no Lawful Impediment, Chaſtity of the Lady, Children, and acknowledgment by the Father of the Children to be his; theſe are not only the ſtrongeſt preſumptions which can be made of a Lawful Marriage; but are of themſelves, as is fully proved in the following Diſcourſe without any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a Marriage Lawful, Holy, and Indiſſoluble. As to the Fifth cauſe of preſumption, which is no Judicial Queſtioning and Sentence againſt the Marriage in the ſpace of Thirty years, in which time all Witneſſes may be Dead, and Writings loſt or burnt; the ſame is ſo high, as by the Laws of the Land, and of all Nations no proof ought to be admitted to the contrary, nor no queſtioning now to be permitted of the ſame; becauſe it is beyond the time of Limitation of Actions, and the peace and ſecurity of all Families and Kingdoms muſt be deſtroyed, ſhould Witneſſes be required Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after of all ſuch Marriages as have not been Judicially queſtion'd and ſentenced in all that time. As to the Sixth cauſe of preſumption, which is the Death of either Party without being Judicially queſtion'd or ſentenced while alive; This by the Law of God and of the Land, is ſo high a preſumption for the Parents, and
<pb facs="tcp:99540:5"/>ſo neceſſary juſtice for the Children, That no Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be admitted to the contrary, nor ought or can the Legitimation of the Child be queſtion'd after the Death of either Parent; yea, though the Marriage of the Parents were Unlawful, as if a man Marry his own Siſter (which is a far more Unlawful Marriage, than to Marry without a Papal or Epiſcopal Ceremony) and have Iſſue by her, if ſhe die before a Judicial hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſentence paſs'd againſt her; her Children are Inheritable, and their Legitimation can never be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd; for ſhe that is Deceaſed cannot be Summon'd before any Humane Tribunal: And if Sentence ſhould be there paſs'd againſt her, ſhe is condemn'd without Hearing; and therefore that the Children ought to be Legitimate and Inheritable, hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the Parliament it ſelf, as may appear <hi>Bro. Deraignement</hi> 5. <hi>Bro. Baſtardy</hi> 23.44. 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3.32. And it is for the ſame reaſon very clear, That if Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> the Wife of <hi>H.</hi> 8. had died before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Sentence paſs'd againſt her, the Legitimation of his Daughter by her, who was afterwards, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> could never have been queſtion'd; and ſhould the Legitimation of the Royal Lines of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other Kingdom in the World, be permitted to be queſtion'd after the Death of one or both of the Parents, It is impoſſible but all certainty and ſecurity of the Succeſſions to them muſt be utterly deſtroyed. As to the Seventh cauſe of preſumption, which is preſumption of a Promiſe of Marriage, to ſhew which, all the foremention'd circumſtances concur, and though the Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>Scotland</hi> keep the people under ſufficient ſervility of their Ceremonies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; yet even thereby the Laws of the Land doth promiſe of Marriage without any Proclamation of Banns or other Ceremony, both Endow the Mother,
<pb facs="tcp:99540:5"/>and Legitimate the Children, as appears <hi>Craig. Feud.</hi> 269.270. As to the laſt Cauſe of Preſumption, which is Filiation, not only the Civil Law, but the Law of God in the Scripture, Legitimates every Son, and makes him Heir to the Father who begot him, either of a Primogenial or Filial Portion, except of Inheritance intail'd to a former Wife, as was that of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Sarah;</hi> and whether this Probation of Filiation is made by the Son or Father, as in the Civil Law is ſaid, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium alicujus ſe eſſe probans, videtur probare ſe eſſe Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum, § Et ib. ad Marg. de Adopt.</hi> who proves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Son to any, proves himſelf Legitimate. And by the ſame Law, ſuch as are proved Children are Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, though there were no Ceremonies of Marriage, <hi>Authen. Collation.</hi> 6. <hi>Novella</hi> 174. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>quibus modis Natur. cap. primo Siquis</hi> 3530. And the Scripture is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in the point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If Children, then Heirs. Et</hi> Gal. 4.7. <hi>If a Son, then an Heir.</hi> (5.) To return again to other Laws of the Land, beſides thoſe of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. It is not neceſſary to prove a Lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by proving Ceremonies: But all Marriage is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Lawful, whether with or without Ceremonies by the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Law of the Land, which is not Prohibited by the Law of God; as appears by the 32 Art. of the 39 Articles, <hi>Roger</hi>'s Articles, <hi>p.</hi> 185. 187, 188. as ſhewn more at large in the Diſcourſe following, and likewiſe in the Statute 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. of Precontracts, wherein there is this Clauſe, <hi>And that no Reſervation or Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition (God's Law except) ſhall Trouble or Impeach any Marriage without the Levitical Degrees:</hi> Whereby it is clear, that this Marriage being without the Levitical Degrees, and not Prohibited by the Law of God, ought not (by the expreſs words of the Act of Parliament) to be troubled or impeach'd by any Humane Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
<pb facs="tcp:99540:6"/>Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal. Which ſaid Act of Parliament, except as to matter of Pre-contracts, ſtands unrepealed to this Day, and of full force. And the Reaſons of the ſaid Act are expreſſed in the Preamble of the ſame, to be becauſe the Uſurped Power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath always intangled and troubled the meer Jurisdiction and Regal Power of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo unquieted much the Subjects of the ſame by his Uſurped Power in them; and by making that Unlawful, which by God's Word is Lawful, both in Marriages and other things. (6.) They whom no Law of the Land makes Illegitimate, are Legitimate by the Law of the Land; But no Law of the Land either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> makes the Children either of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt or Proteſtant born of Marriages not prohibited by the Law of God Illegitimate. Therefore all Children born of Marriages not prohibited by the Law of God, are Legitimate by the Law of the Land; for though ſome Penal Laws have been by Pontifical pretences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, which have preſumed too far to prohibit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Divine Ordinance, Marriages and Meats not prohibited by the Law of God; yet none but the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who in their <hi>Luciferian</hi> Pride pretend to power above God's Law, ever tranſgreſs'd ſo far in theſe Kingdoms, as by ſuch penal Laws to null or make void ſuch Marriages, or to Illegitimate their Children, or though they impoſed penalties on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to impoſe any on the Children; as may appear by the Statutes 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. for <hi>England,</hi> prohibiting Popiſh Recuſants to Marry otherwiſe than by a Miniſter law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully authorized in ſome open Church or Chappel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Orders of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And the Act <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Act</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 88. for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> prohibiting any to Marry in another Kingdom, without the Banns firſt proclaimed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:99540:6"/>that the Omiſſion of Ceremonies contrary to a penal Law, neither Nulls the Marriage, nor Illegitimates the Iſſue; <hi>Vid.</hi> proved before, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 110, 111. (7.) <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra probatur quod probatum non relevat.</hi> It were time miſpent to prove Ceremonies, which when they are proved, prove nothing to the Matters in queſtion, which are, a lawful Lady Companion, as intended by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and an eldeſt Son by her of the Blood of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the rightful preſent Poſſeſſor of the Three Kingdoms, and of the Blood; and of his two ſpecial Predeceſſors King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third of <hi>England,</hi> and King <hi>Ferguſius</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> as to which Probation of the Ceremonies of a Marriage, proves nothing of the Truth or Lawfulneſs of the Marriage; for many Ladies have been Married with all the Ceremonies the Prieſt could lay on them; yet have their Marriages been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawful, and prohibited by the Law of God; nor do they prove the Truth or Lawfulneſs of the Lineal Blood, derived from the Poſſeſſors, or Predeceſſors. As for Example, The Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> were to be of no other Blood but of the race of <hi>Hercules;</hi> theſe were Married with all the Ceremonies accuſtomed in that Kingdom; yet did not thoſe Ceremonies preſerve the Chaſtity of the Queen from being ſo over-familiar with <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> her Husband's ingrateful Gueſt, and whom he had hoſpitably entertain'd, when fled from his own Country of <hi>Athens;</hi> but he having got her with Child, boaſted when he was gone from thence, that he had left Heirs of his Blood to the Kingdom of <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> So <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Spain, Anno Dom.</hi> 1459. having Married his Queen with all the Ceremonies accuſtomed in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but being unable himſelf, perſwaded her to be got with Child by <hi>Bertrand</hi> of <hi>Guttua; Joan</hi> thus gotten, is proclaimed Heir, but refuſed by the people. <hi>Bertrand</hi> is made Earl of <hi>Ledeſma,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Alburquerk.

               <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> Married here in <hi>England, Algine</hi> who was Barren; ſhe to oblige the love of her Husband, feigned her ſelf with Child, and packt one that was Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on her Husband.

(8.) It were a Diſhonour to the Holy Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Profeſſors thereof, to be able to Eſtabliſh the Lawfulneſs and Validity of their Marriages, on no more Sacred Principles than Ceremonies of ſo unclean an Original, as Popes, Common Proſtitutes, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Aruſpices, Aſtrologers, Southſayers, Prieſts of <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> Pagan Gods and Goddeſſes, and <hi>Daemons</hi> themſelves, as is already proved, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 43, 44.51, 52. Then as to Witneſſes, It were an unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tempting of God to caſt what is not the cauſe of a ſingle perſon, but of all the Proteſtants in the Three Kingdoms, on the hazard of ſuch Witneſſes as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Ceremonies Thirty years ſince, and in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Catholick Country will require; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Biſhops and Magiſtrates of that Countrey are Papiſts, and therefore no equal Witneſſes may be had thence, but ſuch as may think it is Meritorious to overthrow the Proteſtants right or wrong; and the ſame Danger is of Witneſſes at home, obnoxious to as great Temptations of Papiſts here, whoſe Religion is
<pb facs="tcp:99540:7"/>not to keep Faith with Hereticks, as they call Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; whereby they may as is commonly practiſed, be corrupted with Money; either in a counterfeit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to offer their Teſtimonies, and when they have Sworn to Recant and Reprobate themſelves, whereby the Truth ſhall be betrayed; or a greater Number of falſe Witneſſes be Suborned to Swear againſt the Truth, then may be got to Swear for it, whereby the Truth ſhall be deſtroyed, or ſuch Judges may be, as will hear no Witneſſes but ſuch as are right for the turn, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Truth will be ſuppreſſed; of which Popiſh pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices too much hath appeared freſh before our Eyes in the Examination of the late Horrid Plot. Therefore no Prudence to give them opportunity to do the like, or worſe, by joyning Iſſue with them on the Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent point of Ceremonies of Marriage, wherein only they are able to corrupt Witneſſes. But it is more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to ſtand on the points of Subſtance of Marriage according to the Law of God, which are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Cohabitation, Conjugal Society, Chaſtity, Children, and acknowledgment of them by the Father to be his, of which God's Providence hath provided ſo many Witneſſes as will be in vain for them to Suborn or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt falſe Witneſſes to the contrary. Beſides, if Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes may be had yet alive after Thirty years time; yet they may Die or be Poiſon'd, or otherwiſe made away when known, before they come to Hearing, or ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified that they will not dare to teſtifie the Truth; why then ſhall all be put in danger by Ceremony, when Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Places all in Security, and it were an injuſt thing Three Kingdoms ſhould be hazarded on the Lives of two or three Witneſſes. To ſpeak at laſt in reference to the Judges and Court, by whom this Marriage ought to be judged, which ought to be only by the King and Parliament, both as to the Fact, and the Law; for as to
<pb facs="tcp:99540:8"/>both the ſame as alleadged being made beyond Sea in a Foreign Catholick Country, not under the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King and Parliament, nor where his Writ runneth: The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> cannot be ſent unto to certifie, becauſe it was made Beyond-ſea, the Foreign Catholick Biſhop cannot be ſent unto to certifie, becauſe he is out of the Juriſdiction. And beſides, by Acts of Parliament all Foreign Certificates, and all other Foreign Acts of Juriſdiction from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Foreign Biſhop ought not to be admitted here; beſides no Foreign Witneſs can either be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to appear here, or to be examin'd there. So as to the Fact of Ceremonies, were they never ſo many at the Marriage, they are impoſſible to be brought to an equal Tryal or Probation here, and the Ceremony that 'twas in a Church conſecrated by a Biſhop; for as <hi>Coke</hi> ſays, no Houſe can be a Church, without ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, which is impoſſible to be Sworn by any Witneſs; For none but God can make place or time Holy, and not a Biſhop; there remains therefore nothing which ought or can, as to the Fact of Marriage be proved here, but the Subſtance of Marriage, which is Cohabitation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Society, Chaſtity and Children, which are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and need no Foreign Witneſſes. Then as to to the Law of the Ceremonies, the Proteſtant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Marriage are by the Law in a Catholick Country Hereſie, and forbidden. The Catholick Ceremonies are forbidden here. Theſe Ceremonies therefore in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Marriage, can neither be judged here by the Law of the Catholick Country, becauſe it concerns In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which lyes in <hi>England;</hi> nor by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the Fact was done in a Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it ought therefore only to be judged by the Moral Law of God which judgeth according to Subſtance, and not Ceremonies, and is the Univerſal Law of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p>The Statute made 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in a Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> called <hi>Poyning</hi>'s <hi>Law:</hi> The words of which are theſe,</p>

                  <p>It is Enacted, That all Statutes late made within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> concerning or belonging to the Common or Publick Weal of the ſame, from henceforth be deemed Good and Effectual in the Law, and ever that be accepted, uſed and executed within this Land of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in all Points, and at all times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite according to the Tenor and Effect of the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>Concluſion</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>This being granted, That if the Eldeſt Son had happen'd
<pb facs="tcp:99540:15"/>to Die in the Life of his Father, the Eldeſt Son of the Prince who died, ſhould have Succeeded <hi>Jure Repreſentationis</hi> of his own Father, as Heir Lineal to his Grandfather, and excluded the Grandfather's Younger Son, who is his Uncle, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> muſt it be granted, that if both Grandfather and Father die, the Eldeſt Son who is the Grandchild Surviving, he ought to exclude his Uncle; for he now comes in <hi>Jure proprio</hi> which is a greater Right than <hi>Jure repreſentationis;</hi> and if the leſs Right exclude the Uncle, much more muſt the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>When the Right of the Crown ſhall actual deſcend from the King in Poſſeſſion, on the Eldeſt Son in Poſſeſſion, who is the next Lineal Heir of his Blood, then is the Son Actually King both <hi>De Facto,</hi> and <hi>De Jure,</hi> as was his Father who died in Poſſeſſion of the Kingdoms. And therefore all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Acts of Parliament, and Common Laws of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Imperial Laws with them unanimouſly declare, It will be not only then High Treaſon to Compaſs the Death, Exile or Diſinheriting of the King's Eldeſt Son, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe is High Treaſon againſt a King, will be the ſame againſt him.</p>

The King (ſaith he) having by ſo great a Wickedneſs eſtabliſhed his Kingdom, as he thought, to his Poſterity, he could not Eſtabliſh his Mind; for although he courted all ſorts of Men with the higheſt ſhew of Love and Courteſie, and ſo managed the Affairs of the Kingdom, that there was nothing wanting which ſhewed him not a good King; Yet his Mind perpetually diſquieted with the conſcience of his wicked fact, ſuffered him not to have any ſolid or ſincere joy, but the thoughts of his foul Crime ruſhing into his memory, vexed him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99540:16"/>by Day and by Night, moſt horrible Dreams diſturbed his reſt; at length, whether truly (as ſome affirm) or whether his troubled thoughts made him ſo fancy what oftentimes happens to Guilty perſons, a voice came from Heaven, by which he ſeemed in his ſleep to be warned, <hi>Doeſt thou think the Murder of</hi> Milcolumbus, <hi>an Innocent Perſon, committed by thee moſt wickedly in Secret, is hid from me? or that I will any longer ſuffer it to paſs without puniſhment? For already there are Plots laid by Treaſon, which thou ſhalt not eſcape, to take away thy Life; neither ſhalt thou (as thou thinkeſt) leave thy Kingdom Stable or Secure, but full of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Tempeſts to thy Poſterity.</hi> With which fearful Dream the King being terrified, Early in the Morning he flyes to the Biſhops and Monks, and declares to them the Confuſion of his Mind, and Anguiſh of his Conſcience for his Crime; but they gave him no true Remedy from the Doctrine of Chriſt (for they had already degenerated from the Piety and Learning of the Ancient Profeſsors); But adviſed thoſe many abſurdities Long ſince invented by wicked Perſons for their own gains, and raſhly believed of the Unlearned and Overcredulous, That he ſhould inrich with Gifts the Holy Places and Temples, and ſhould viſit the Sepulchres of the Saints, kiſs their Reliques, redeem his Sins by Maſses and Alms, and ſhould have a greater Honour and Reverence for the Monks and Prieſts, than he had formerly us'd to have.

What (ſaith he) is more fooliſh than to take away a matter of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern from the Votes of Wiſe Men in Parliament, and to caſt it on the Wheel of Fortune; and that theſe ſhould bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ruled by a Child who hath the chance to be born, and who is ruled by ſome petty Woman, and drive away moſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99540:16"/>Valiant Men from aſſiſtance in the Government?

There is neither the word Marriage, Maſs Book, Common-Prayer Book, Book of Cannons, or Ordinance of Parilament, Prieſt or Temple named in the Statute; therefore being not expreſſed, they are not to be intended in ſo wiſe a Statute which minded ſubſtance and not Ceremonies, and Safety of the Royal Blood and not Inſecurity and Incertainty.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Admit the Statute had in expreſs terms ſaid our Lady his Companion married by the Maſs-book, which was the Book then in Faſhion, at time of this Statute, yet none will deny, but when by a ſucceeding Power this Maſs-Book was aboliſhed or changed,<note place="margin">Marriage by the Common-Drayer-Book not neceſſary in time of War.</note> as in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 5. the Service Book of <hi>Pauls</hi> was changed into the Service Book of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that none need to marry according to it. Then as to the Common-Prayer, and Book of Cannons at the time of the Princes taking his Lady Companion, it is known that both Maſs-Book, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer Book, Book of Cannons, and all were aboliſhed by the then Power of the Sword, and it might have been Death for a Prince to have married by a Book of Common-Prayer, or in Publick.

And in the latter times of Potentates of Interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Common-Prayer Book, and Marriage by it, can any, I ſay, be ſo ſenſleſs as to cenſure in ſuch a time thoſe who

                     <p n="3">(3.) There is another Circumſtance in this Caſe, which makes it both Unlawful and Impoſſible to queſtion the Validity of this Marriage, becauſe without Maſs-Book or Common-Prayer, or Ordinance of Parliament; for the Lady Mother,<note place="margin">The Mother being dead, the Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Child not to be queſtioned.</note> who was the Royal firſt Companion, is now dead; And by Law of God and Man none ought to be Cenſured without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and anſwering for her ſelf, which now is impoſſible; for who knowes, if Queſtion'd while alive, What beſides the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of War, ſhe could have alledged both as to the Fact and Law; what Matrimonial Promiſes or Contracts Verbal or in Writing; what Matrimonial Truſts, what Witneſs, what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe could have produced: For which reaſon, even by our own Laws, as appears 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3.32. If a man Marry his own Siſter, which is a very unlawful Inceſtuous Marriage, and contrary to the Law of God, and hath Iſſue by her, and ſhe dyes, if not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially Queſtioned and Sentenced for it in her Life-time; the Legitimation of her Iſſue ſhall not be queſtioned after her death, becauſe ſhe was not Summon'd to anſwer while alive. Of which, ſee more before in the Preface.

But in this Caſe where there is no Inceſt, nor any other matter in the leaſt, prohibited by the Law of God, nor pretence or colour of any but the omiſſion of a Petty Ceremony of a Common-Prayer-Book, a human Law, and that in a time of War too, when aboliſhed, to violate the Sanctuary of the Sepulcher and the Deceaſed, ſeems not only Unchriſtian but Barbarous.

The ſinal cauſes were,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That the Prieſts might have no Dependance or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der command of the Lay-Lords, by reaſon of their Wives and Families; for whom, if they kept them, they would be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to provide Lay-Maintenance, the Spiritual being too ſhort Commons for ſo many.</item>
                        <item>2. That what Wives and Children the Prieſts had, they might ſit by other mens Fires, and be maintained at other mens Tables, and ſucceed to other mens Inheritances.</item>
                        <item>3. That the Prieſts might be the Richer and Abler to pay
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99540:32"/>the more Tributes and Taxes to the Pope.</item>
                        <item>4. That they might be provoked to Lye with the more Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Wives, and thereby fiſh out all the Secrets of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for Intelligence to Lay their own Plots, and diſcover thoſe againſt them in Auricular Confeſſion.</item>
                        <item>5. That they might not be put to the uſual Coſt of Intelligence, which is commonly very Dear, but might by this way be had for nothing, and probably with Rewards to ſuch Gallants.</item>
                        <item>6. That between the Woman and the Prieſt, they might Rob the Lay-man of his Goods, and ſhare it between them.</item>
                        <item>7. That when the Lay-man was come to die, the Woman, to whom her Living man was more pleaſant than her Dying, might perſuade him to make the Prieſt Overſeer of his Goods, and of the Children he had got for him; And to give Land to Pious (that is to ſay) Pontifical Uſes.</item>
                        <item>8. That the Lay-men might not Lye with the Prieſts Wives, and return to them the <hi>Talio,</hi> to which end they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Judges of the Cauſes of Divorce; And made ſtrict Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons Prohibiting the Lay Divorce <hi>à Vinculo,</hi> for Adult'ry, and that they ſhould give Surety and Bond, though Divorced <hi>à Mensâ &amp; Thoro,</hi> while either was Living, never to Marry again; but the Prieſts might turn off their Courteſans, if they ſuſpected a Lay-man had been with them, when they pleaſed.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>So the Prieſt who was the Malefactor and Adulterer with the Lay-man's Wife, was Judge in his own Caſe of the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's cauſe of Divorce, and would not allow it if he were within the four Seas; but none but himſelf was Judge of the cauſe of his Courteſans Divorce, which he may do Arbitrarily, and only for change at his pleaſure. But this Prohibition of Marriage to the Clergy, nor the miſchiefs thereof could not have been without Compulſion to the Ceremony of a Prieſt and a Temple in Marriage; nor could the Canon of <hi>Trent</hi> have found any other Ceremony by the omiſſion of which to have made all other Marriages null and void, becauſe no other Ceremony is in the Power of the Prieſt to compel men to, or can be Teſtified by him againſt thoſe who omit it; nor can any other Ceremony be raiſed to ſo Luciferian an height, as to make a Ceremonial Law of Pope or Biſhop, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99540:32"/>a Marriage by the Moral Law of God. But if any Prieſt ſhould take a Woman, and intend to make a Courteſan of her, yet get her with Child, And Liberty of Conſcience were given to ſuch as Marry, to uſe ſuch Ceremony or not uſe it, then would this intended Courteſan deceive the Prieſt in his filthy bargain, to have her only as a Courteſan, and follow him as a Wife, according to the Moral Law of God, with her Children, and ſo ſpoil his Trade of Confeſſing other mens Wives in ſecret; and if he kept not at home only with her, perhaps penance him as bad as he penanceth others. For no other Ceremony, deſignation or mark of difference could have been put between a Woman got with Child by a Prieſt, and his Wife, but the omiſſion of this Ceremony, which every Prieſt would omit of purpoſe to free himſelf from her and her Children when he pleaſed, though not the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (the more beaſt he.)</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) Without this Ceremony of a Prieſt and a Temple, they could not pretend to make Marriage a Sacrament; nor could the Pope pretend the Supreme Jurisdiction of Marriage, whereby he preſumeth to Depoſe Kings, and Diſpoſe of the Succeſſion of Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) Without Compulſion to the Ceremony of a Prieſt or a Temple in Marriage, the Biſhop could make no Certificate againſt any Marriage, according to the Moral Law of God, to be no Marriage.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) The <hi>Theodora</hi>'s could not put in Adulterous Heirs into their Husband's Inheritance at their pleaſure, while they are within the four Seas, if their Husbands had Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience allowed to marry according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of God, without the Ceremony of a Prieſt and Temple.</p>

                     <p>The Civilians, Canoniſts, Common-Lawyers, Divines, Schoolmen and Caſuiſts, are as much out in the word <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> as they are in the word <hi>Marriage.</hi> And all the Kennels follow with full Crys the firſt who but opened his mouth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſearch further; and as they have thereby falſely made a Contract to Marry, to be the very Act of Marriage; So have they falſely made the Contract of Matrimony to be the very Act of Matrimony. And this Error they fell not into by Ignorance, but Fraud. And the Popiſh Prieſts firſt took the Preſident from the Pagan. For without falſe naming what is not Mariage, to be Marriage; and what is Marriage,<note place="margin">Why Prieſts falſe named Marriage Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</note> not to be Marriage; and what is not Matrimony, to be Matrimony; and what is Matrimony, not to be Matrimony; they could not have call'd Evil, Good; and Good, Evil; neither could they have perverted the Moral Law and Text of Scripture, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Adult'ry and Fornication under the falſe Name of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Matrimony; and puniſh Marriage and Matrimony, under the falſe Name of Adultery and Fornication, to their great Gains.</p>
                     <p>Matrimony, therefore, every one knows is derived from <hi>Matre,</hi> a Mother;<note place="margin">Matrimony none without a Child.</note> and without a Mother there can be no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: A Contract to make a Woman a Mother, is ſo far from the Act of Performance which is Matrimony, that it ſeems a Preſumptuous and void Contract, becauſe impoſſible to be performed by the Contractor; for though he may Contract to bye with a Woman, which is Marriage, and it may be in his Power to perform it, yet it is not in his Power to make her a Mother; for the conception and birth of a Child is a Miracle which none but God can do: and of this the Scripture is full,<note place="margin">Birth of a Child the Act of God, and not of Man.</note>

For there never was a Law of the Land,<note place="margin">The word Lawful Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</note> or Law of God, or Contract ſo clear, but Lawyers Eccleſiaſtical or Common for Money have raiſed Queſtions and Doubts in, where the word <hi>Lawful,</hi> or any word aequipollent or to that Effect is expreſs'd: For firſt, when the word is not expreſſed, there can no Law be Implied or Intended to Judge Lawfulneſs by, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99540:34"/>the Moral Law of God. But when it is expreſs'd, as in the words, <hi>Lawful Marriage,</hi> or, <hi>Lawfully begotten,</hi> they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them by Laws Papal and Epiſcopal, which are not the Laws of the Land; and by Laws making <hi>Mala prohibita,</hi> and not <hi>Mala in ſe,</hi> which are not the Laws of God; whereas, where it is not expreſs'd, it can only be Expounded by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of God, which is above all Humane Laws and Statutes. Secondly,<note place="margin">A Lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor may be of an unlawful Marriage.</note> Becauſe an Act of Parliament may make the Iſſue of a Marriage, though unlawful and contrary to the Law of God, Heir to a Kingdom; As the Marriage of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s Wife, accompliſhed by Adultery with her, and the Murder of her Husband, yet was <hi>Solomon</hi> Lawfully made Heir to ſucceed <hi>David.</hi> So <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth ſucceeded to <hi>Henry</hi> 8th, yet was his Mother Married while <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> his former Wife, was alive. And that the unlawful Marriages of Parents ought not Illegitimate, or be an Impediment to the Succeſſion of Children, is fully already proved, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 80. And to the ſame end the preſent Statute Enacts no more in general for the ſafety of the eldeſt Sons of all Kings, than the Famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. doth for her own Heirs in particular; by which Statute it is Enacted to be High Treaſon, To affirm that any ought to be Heir and Succeſſor to the Queen,<note place="margin">The Crown entailed to the Natural and not Lawful Iſſue of the Body of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                        </note> except the ſame be the natural Iſſue of Her Body. So the old Leſſon of the Lawyers of the words, <hi>Lawfully begotten,</hi> is left out; yet no queſtion that Pious Queen intended more Lawful Heirs, than they with their Indentures, and the Prieſts with their Banns or Benedictions uſed to make. (4) Becauſe though Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to private Patrimonies may be held in ſuſpence by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of lawful and unlawful, yet ought not Succeſſions to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſo to be, which many times not only the leaſt Delay, but even the neglect of clearing all Doubts, and declaring the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor before-hand, deſtroys or involves in moſt bloody Civil Wars to be after deſtroyed. (5) Becauſe as is before touched concerning the word <hi>Queen,</hi> no Penal Statute ought or can be Extended by Equity, nor any thing be made within an Act of Treaſon, but what is within the Letter of the ſame. But ſuch Marriages or other Matters which are by any other Statute made High Treaſon, ought to be Expounded to be within that Statute within the Letter of which is ſo named or made; And not within the Intention of this Statute wherein it is not ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99540:35"/>made. As by the ſaid 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. It is made High Treaſon to affirm, That the Laws and Statutes do not bind the Succeſſion of the Crown, that is Treaſon within the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. But not within the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. for all which Reaſons though as 'tis at firſt ſaid, It were ſufficient to deny the Sequel and ſay no more, yet that Malice it ſelf may not have any pretence to Cavil, I hope by God's aſſiſtance, Briefly, Cleerly, and Unanſwerably, when the next Objection is anſwered, to prove ſhe was both <hi>De Facto</hi> and <hi>De Jure,</hi> Married according to the Law of God.</p>

                     <p n="2">(2.) There's no middle word between a Wife, and Whore; for if a Woman is taken for life, ſhe is a Wife; if only <hi>pro hâc vice;</hi> or for a leſſer Term than life, ſhe is a Whore; and there's no middle Station for the limits of a Wife between the firſt time of Marriage, and the end of Life.</p>

                     <p n="4">(4.) There's no indifferent Wife between a Lawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; for though a Lawful Wife is called a Wife, yet is not therefore an unlawful Wife call'd a Concubine, either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or our own Laws, as appears 1 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 11. The title of which Act is, <hi>That it ſhall be Felony to Marry a ſecond Husband or Wife, the former being Living;</hi> which Act calls this higheſt ſort of unlawful Wife, a Wife, though ſhe be a Whore, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſs; and as there is no ſuch word as <hi>Concubine</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo there's no ſuch word in the Law of the Land.

A Penal Statute cannot be extended by Equity to make Treaſon againſt an Heir ſo made only by Certificate of the Biſhop, feeing the Letter of the Statute makes not any ſuch Treaſon; and it would be of very dangerous Conſequence, to make any Intentional or Expreſs Statute to give Power to any Biſhop or Arch-Biſhop to declare Kings or their Succeſſors by Certificates under pain of Treaſon: for then is the old Papal Power, and greater than the Papal, put into their hands of making and depoſing them at their pleaſure, either under Pain of Excommunication or Treaſon; and the power of Declaring or laying the Penalty of Treaſon in the Biſhop, would be greater than it was of Excommunication in the Pope.</item>

                        </note>2. The Original of Certificates by the Biſhop or High Prieſts, of Filiation, began likewiſe from the Incertainty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were caſt into by theſe Promiſcuous copulations at their Temples or Groves, or other Publick Conventions by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Prieſt; who that he might not loſe his fees kept a Regiſter or Toll-Book, where theſe who coupled for that time had their names entred to have paid them their fee. And when the Child got there, was grown to diſcretion to enquire who was his Father, his Mother, who had play'd the Whore with ſo many Strangers at the ſeveral Sacrifices, could not tell, unleſs ſhe ſent to the Prieſt who kept the <hi>Priapeian</hi> Sacrifice at that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99540:40"/>time which ſuited neareſt her Child's Age, to ſend a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the name of the Perſon or Perſons were then entred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her name in his Toll-Book.

Secondly, The Pagan Prieſt entred in his Regiſter every time the Woman copulated with a Man; for which he had a new Fee. But the Biſhop will undertake that if it be but once ſet down in his Regiſter, That ſuch a Man and Woman came to his Temple, though they never came near one another afterward, or the next day deſerted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the Woman being beforehand with Child by an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, was the next day after ſhe had been thus with the Man at the Temple delivered of ſuch an Adulterous Child, or begot with Child, or was Delivered of Twenty Children ſucceſſively by twenty Adulterers for twenty years after; yet the Biſhop will make a ridiculous, beaſtly and wicked Certificate. And <hi>Littleton</hi> and <hi>Coke,</hi> bear him out in it, That in all theſe caſes the Man who went Twenty years ſince with this Woman to his Temple, if he were within the Four Sees at the time of the begetting of theſe Adulterous Children by the Adulterers; yet he the Man within the Four Sees begot them, and <hi>Probatio non admittitur in contrarium.</hi> Oh! Excellent Law, and excellent Divinity. The Certificates of the Prieſts of <hi>Priapus</hi> are very bad, but theſe Epiſcopal Certificates are ten times worſe. But I muſt, for brevity, refer the Reader to what hath been ſaid before, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1, <hi>p.</hi> 72, 73. The original of theſe Certificates of Filiation by Prieſts for other cauſes, were likewiſe either Cheats of the Prieſts, or came from the Actual Reſponſe of the Devil: So the Prieſts would anciently attribute the begetting of any Child whoſe Father was unknown, if he proved an <hi>Hero,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Prieſt fathered Men on the Gods.</note> or had any other Excellence, eſpecially if Rich, and gave him Money, to ſome of the Gods; as <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> were fathered on <hi>Mars; Plato</hi> on <hi>Apollo;</hi> and <hi>Vulcan</hi> they made himſelf a God, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> without a Father. But the greateſt number of them they laid at <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Door, who no queſtion had a great charge upon his hands, and ſometimes when the Mother was unknown, they Mother'd him on ſome Goddeſs or other, as <hi>Achilles</hi> on <hi>Thetis; Aeneas</hi> on <hi>Venus;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99540:40"/>Oedipus</hi> not knowing his Father whom he had ſlain, nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wnom he had Married, had a Reſponſe from the Oracle, or Certificate from the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which acquainted him with the ſame. And <hi>Alexander,</hi> ambitious to have a greater Father than <hi>Philip,</hi> ſent to the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> and for a great Sum of Gold had either a Reſponſe from the Devil, or a cheating Certificate from the Prieſt, That he was the Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But we never hear amongſt the Pagans themſelves, of any Son who was ſo wiſe to know his own Father, or was not aſhamed of him who went for a Certificate to the Prieſt or the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) The final Cauſes why they ſo eagerly deſire the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Marriage and Filiation by this Power of making Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, are their Covetouſneſs and Ambition, <hi>vid.</hi> at Large, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 53. <hi>ad</hi> 57.<note place="margin">Popery ruin'd if Epiſcopal Juriſdiction of Marriage were taken away.</note> And that the Pope were ruined if Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Jurisdiction of Marriage and Filiation, and their Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates ſhould be taken away, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 184.

                           </item>
                        </list> Now it is manifeſt Chriſt intended not <hi>Coemptione, Inſtrumentis,</hi> or <hi>Confarriatione;</hi> all which kinds are already before explained what they are. For firſt he intended only that kind of Marriage which maketh one fleſh, as he expreſly declareth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4, 5, and 6. which is only Carnal knowledge. Therefore he intended not Coemption or Marriage Writings, or the Ceremony of Confarriation by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Barley Cake before a Prieſt in a Temple; for none of theſe make the Man and Woman one fleſh. Secondly, Chriſt expreſly declares <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. and 8. That he intends ſuch a kind of Marriage as was from the beginning, that is, from the time of the Creation of Male and Female. Now it is clear that there was no kind of Marriage from the beginning but ſimple Carnal knowledge without Ceremony, and ſecret without Witneſs, except God only; and no ſuch thing as Coemption or buying or ſelling Women for Money, without writing, or buying or ſelling them for Joyntures or Thirds by Indentures or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments written, nor buying or ſelling them for Fees by the Prieſt for his Confarriations and other ridiculous Ceremonies. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſt whipt all Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and intended they ſhould not buy or ſell there; much leſs did he intend they ſhould buy or ſell there God's holy Ordinance of Marriage. Fourthly, Chriſt aboliſhed all Ceremonies, and taught the Worſhip of God ought to be in Spirit. And Fifthly, Chriſt never Inſtituted any Marriage by a Prieſt, nor did he or his Apoſtles ever Marry a Man and a Woman: he intended not therefore ſuch kind of Marriage, which neither God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted nor of which he from God gave either Precept or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Sixthly, Chriſt only intended ſuch Marriages, whereof according to God's Ordinance, the Poor might take equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit with the Rich: For he ſaith, <hi>to the Poor the Goſpel is preached,</hi> but the Poor can take no benefit of Coemptions or buying of Women for Money, or for Jointures or Thirds, nor are able to give Fees to Lawyers for Indentures, or to Prieſts for Ceremonies, or to buy Licenſes or Gold Rings, or to pay ſo much as for Banns or Proclamations; Chriſt therefore never intended they ſhould be Prohibited all Marriage, except it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99540:58"/>were <hi>Coemptione, Inſtrumentis,</hi> or <hi>Confarriatione;</hi> he gave them therefore that Marriage which was <hi>Copulatione;</hi> otherwiſe they could have the benefit of no Marriage at all. Seventhly, 'Tis manifeſt that Chriſt makes the Marriage <hi>Copulatione</hi> to be the Ordinance of God which was from the beginning; for which a man ſhould leave father and Mother, and ſhould cleave to his Wife, and this was the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Law of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and Chriſt doth eſtabliſh and confirm it by forbidding any Divorce except for Fornication, which in the Woman is <hi>Polyandry,</hi> and according to the Maxim of Nature, <hi>

And I ſhall, as to the two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars here mention'd, further ſhew, firſt therefore, That <hi>Haeres
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99540:61"/>Sanguinis,</hi> is intended in this Statute, and not <hi>Hares Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe <hi>Haeres Sanguinis,</hi> is <hi>Haeres deſignans;</hi> &amp; <hi>Haeres Haereditatis, Haeres deſignatus,</hi> to be known by the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe the words of the Statute are, <hi>our Lord the King, the Lady his Companion, or their Eldeſt Son and Heir:</hi> Now the Heir of the Inheritance of a Kingdom cannot be intended, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he derives his Title to the ſame only from the King, and not from the Lady Companion, unleſs a Queen Regnant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot be the Heir of both of them, as he is <hi>Haeres He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditatis;</hi> but as he is <hi>Haeres Sanguinis,</hi> he is Heir of the Blood of both of them, which is the only Heir, intended by this Statute. Secondly, ſeeing the <hi>Heir of Blood,</hi> is in the Expreſs words of the Statute: And no words at all of the Heir of the Inheritance, therefore the Heir of Inheritance ought not to be put in the intention, otherwiſe than as <hi>Haeres deſignatus,</hi> marked to be known, by the firſt knowing who is <hi>Haeres Sanguinis,</hi> becauſe then a Penal Statute would be extended by Equity.</p>
                     <p>And as to the other Particular, It is manifeſt, That <hi>Haeres viventis</hi> is intended in this Statute, and not <hi>Haeres defuncti,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept before he is born, and not after. Firſt, becauſe the eldeſt Son who is <hi>Haeres Sanguinis,</hi> moſt times happens to be born in the life-time of his Father, and not to be a <hi>Roſthume,</hi> and, <hi>ad ea quae frequentius accidunt Jura adaptantur.</hi> Therefore <hi>Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> which do rarely happen to be eldeſt Sons, ſhall not be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to be within the Statute, and the eldeſt Son on whom the Royal Blood deſcended <hi>en ventre ſa mere;</hi> And he was Heir to the ſame before he was born, be therefore excluded, becauſe he is <hi>Haeres viventis</hi> to the ſame after he is born, and his Father died not before his Birth. Secondly, The words of the Statute, Reſtrain not the Heir to be, <hi>Haeres defuncti;</hi> before he is born, or after he is born; therefore to reſtrain by the intention of either, is to extend a Penal Statute by Equity; which ought not to be done. Thirdly, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf, 3 <hi>part, fol.</hi> 9. in his Expoſition on this Statute, ſays, That <hi>Heir,</hi> is here taken for Heir apparent, for he cannot be Heir in the life of the Father.<note place="margin">Haeres viventis <hi>intended</hi> Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Sanguinis <hi>and not</hi> Haeres Haereditatis.</note> It is a clear miſtake; for firſt, an Heir apparent can only be of the King, but the Statute makes him Heir both to King and Lady, and the catch which they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99540:61"/>have got of <hi>Haeres non eſt viventis,</hi> was never intended to be any other than <hi>Haeres Haereditatis,</hi> which kind of Heir is before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably Proved not to be intended within this Statute. And if it had, the Statute had ſerved to little purpoſe to aſcertain the Heir of the Crown, ſo many ſorts of Laws and Cuſtoms pretending to be the Rule of Judgment of <hi>Haeres Haereditatis:</hi> but the eldeſt Son, who is <hi>Haeres Sanguinis,</hi> as is already ſhewn, can be but one in the Three Kingdoms; and that the King's eldeſt Son, who is <hi>Haeres Sanguinis,</hi> the Chief Heir of his Blood, by the Law of Nature, and not him who is made <hi>Haeres Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatis</hi> by Papal and Epiſcopal Laws. When <hi>Theſeus</hi> had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Death of his Vertuous, Valiant and eldeſt Son <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> by the falſe Calumnies of <hi>Phaedra</hi> his Stepmother, he crys out,</p>

Let not the Proteſtant Clergy therefore, nor the Biſhops be deceived, or vainly flatter themſelves that they can compound or lay the Obligation of an Oath, or an Act of Parliament on a Papiſt Succeſſor if any happen to be; nor think he will loſe ſo infinite heaps of Treaſures, as this point of the Marriage of the Clergy, and the Illegitimation of their Deſcendents, will by Confiſcations of all the Jointures, Dowers, Thirds of all the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and inferiour Clergies Wives, and of the Succeſſions of their Poſterities in the Three Kingdoms, will bring into his Treaſury; Therefore certainly if a Papiſt

                        <hi>Of the Inſolent Abſurdity of Popiſh Laws, diſinheriting the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sons of Kings by the Law of God, and Inheriting the Baſtards of Popes by the Law of the Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If a Son, then an Heir;</hi> that is to ſay, to the Father who begot him, and not to a Fictitious Father. But the Popiſh Law, or what is above it the Practique, ſaith, Let none be an Heir of a Marriage not Contracted by a Prieſt in a Temple, except a Baſtard of a Pope; in which the Law of New <hi>Rome</hi> follows that of old Pagan <hi>Rome;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited ſome kind of Women to the Subjects; but gave Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to lye with what Women he would. And the like to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> falſe Prophet, is imitated by the falſe Prophet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> who in his <hi>Alchoran</hi> prohibited divers Women to the people but counterfeits God, ſpeaking to himſelf and ſaying, <hi>But as for thee, O Prophet, thou may'ſt Lye with what Women thou wilt.</hi> But in this the Pope goes beyond <hi>Mahomet;</hi> for the one Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates no Children, nor diſinherits them; but the other all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99540:74"/>of Women not Churched, except his own. So Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth is related to have gotten out of his Leaden Bulls in a ſmall time Twenty hundred Thouſand Scutes of Gold, with all which he bought Lands for his Baſtards, and Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> the Fifth, being himſelf the Son of a Swineheard created his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard a Cardinal, and gave him Ten Thouſand Crowns <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> Revenue, and beſides Left at his Death Ten Millions of Treaſure. Another Pope gave his Baſtard the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and divers Principalities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and a vaſt heap of Treaſure. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth intended likewiſe to have given his Baſtard Son <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> a Kingdom (whom though the verieſt Villain in the World) <hi>Matchiavel</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De Principe,</hi> propoſeth as the only Example for Kings to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. And by Probability a Kingdom he had obtained, had he not and his Father by the juſt Judgment of God, been Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the ſame invenomed Wine at a Banquet; which they had prepared for others. All <hi>Italy</hi> is already over-ſtocked, and the Principallities thereof, and of other Catholick Countries, in time likely to be the Inheritances of none but of the Baſtards of Popes, and their Deſcendents Male or Female, under the Name of Nephews, and Neices, and by the Matches of Papal Deſcendents into Proteſtant Dominions, the like Evil may be juſtly feared, if not prevented; and what is worſe, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating thereby of their Superſtition from Generation to Generation.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture likewiſe ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Marriage is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in all, and the bed undefiled; but Whoremongers and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers God ſhall Judge:</hi> But the Popiſh Law ſaith, no Marriages are Honourable made by the Law of God, unleſs made by the Papal Laws, nor the Children; nor Chaſtity, nor the Bed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, nor the Sons though of Kings, deſcending from the ſame, according to the Foundation of all Honour, the Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Law of God. But the Baſtards of Popes, ſuch is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to Prohibit Honour to all except her ſelf and her Brats. And as to theſe, Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Second Uſurped the Authority when he pleaſed to create them Kings, Dukes, Earls, and Knights, and hath plagued and incumbred the World with fictitious Titles of Honour; but he vouchſafes the lawful Sons of Kings no better Title than Baſe Sons, except they receive from him the mark of the Beaſt. This
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99540:75"/>is not ſtrange that Swineheard Popes and their Trulls, ſhould not only not diſinherit nor degrade their own Blood, but extol the ſame above the Imperial: But 'tis ſtrange that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors and Princes ſhould have ever been ſo Pope or Prieſt-Ridden, or ſo far have ſuffer'd them to have ſet their foot on their Necks, as to Kick from their Heads the Crowns and Honours of them and their Sons, for the Baſtards of Popes to inherit and to diſinherit their own, for which not only his Holineſs himſelf derides them, but they become a Deriſion to <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and all the World beſides, none of them being ſo fooliſh to admit the Doctrine of Devils, of Prohibiting Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages not Prohibited by God amongſt them, or Illegitimating the Children of ſuch Marriages.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It is already proved, That Carnal Knowledge, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and Childbirth makes a Marriage, Lawful, Holy, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble by the Law of God between all perſons not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. And it is notorious, That Popes have kept openly their Whores and their Baſtards, and Rule what they call their Holy Church by them. So did <hi>Theodora</hi> the Impudent Concubine of the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> rule all <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave her Daughter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rozia,</hi> as wicked a Queen as her Mother to be Concubine to Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the Third, of whom he begot him who was afterwards his Baſtard Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth, the Mother <hi>Marozia</hi> poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 6. and Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> 7. And got her Baſtard Boy to be Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth. Pope <hi>John</hi> the Thirteenth was depoſed in Council, <hi>Anno</hi> 961; for abuſing his Father's Concubines, for Gelding ſome Men, and putting out the Eyes of others, for Drinking a health to the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the Fifth was a Common Fornicator; and it is Notorious, That all Popes are Panders-General of all the Stews and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Fornication in <hi>Rome,</hi> and fill their Treaſuries with the hires of Whores. And are theſe fit Fellows to make Marriages Holy, or to make Laws to overthrow God's Holy Ordinance, and diſpoſe thereby of the Succeſſion of Proteſtant Kingdoms?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, I am not Ignorant how dangerous it is to move this Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I ſeem to my ſelf moſt Juſtly to abſtain from Calling a Kingdom in Poſſeſſion into Diſpute concerning the Right; for it is ſo often already Controverted what is Lawful Matrimony, who are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, and who are Illegitimate Children, according to every man's Opinion, and as he favours this or that Party, That I my ſelf by Reaſon of theſe Diſputes, have been hitherto more ſlow to Marry; once when I Publickly received the Crown, I was Married to my Kingdom, and as a pledge of which I always wear this Ring: And howſoever theſe Affairs ſtand, I will as long as I live be Queen of</hi> England; <hi>when I am dead, let who hath the beſt Right be my Succeſſor. If your Queen is ſhe, I will no way be againſt her; if another hath Right, I will not do him wrong: If there is a Law againſt your Queen, it is unknown to me; for I do not make willingly any curious Inquiſition after this matter: But if there is any ſuch Law, I took an Oath when I took the Kingdom, that I will not Change my Subjects Laws without their aſſent. But as to what you have alleadged in the ſecond place, That this Declaring a Succeſſor will contract a ſtraighter Friendſhip between us, I rather fear it will ſow hatred; for do you think that I ſhall take any Delight to have my Funeral prepared always ſet before me? It is a Peculiar of Kings, that they have no friendly mind to Children, who by Birth-right claim to be their Succeſſors when they are dead. Of what mind was</hi> Charles <hi>the Seventh the</hi> French <hi>King, againſt</hi> Lewis <hi>the Eleventh, and he againſt</hi> Charles <hi>the Eighth, or</hi> Francis
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99540:79"/>
                     <hi>lately againſt</hi> Henry? <hi>Of what mind therefore is it likely I ſhall be againſt my Neighbour, when once Declared my Succeſſor? To this may be added what I think of very great weight, I know the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inconstancy; I know how full they are of the preſent ſtate of things; I know what prying eyes they have into the next Succeſſor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Riſing Sun is only a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Heir.</note> 
                     <hi>I know it is natural for more to adore the Riſing than the Setting Sun; And, to omit other Examples, I have ſeen enough in my own Time, when my Siſter</hi> Mary <hi>held the Kingdom, what Prayers and they make to ſee me ſet in her Throne? With what eagerneſs were my Concerns carried on; neither am Ignorant to undergo what dangers they would have hazarded, if I would have joyned with them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deſire: But now perhaps the ſame Men have not the ſame Mind towards me, Like Children who in ſleep rejoyce for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples off'red them in a Dream, and preſently awaked in the Morning, when deceived in their hopes, Change their Joy into Weeping. So they who with great Good will applied to me while I was called</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth; <hi>and if I beheld any with a more ſmiling Countenance, they forthwith thought with themſelves, that as ſoon as I obtained the Kingdom, they ſhould be rewarded rather according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Deſires, than of the good they had done me; but now when the Event anſwers not their Expectation, many of them would be ready to Change to any ſtate of things, ſo they might but gain a better fortune: For no Riches of any Prince though never ſo great, are ſufficient to ſatisfie the inſatiable deſires of Men. Now if the affections of our People will Languiſh, either for Moderate gifts, or any other Light cauſe, what will ſuch Malevalents do, if they have a certain Succeſſor, to whom to carry their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, or go themſelves, when they are angry? In what Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger do you think I ſhall be near ſo Potent a Prince my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, to whom how much ſtrength I add, ſo much I take from my own Security. This Danger by no Cautions or Bonds of Laws can be averted, neither will Princes who fail of their hopes of a Kingdom, eaſily contain themſelves within the Bounds of Right and Equity. And for my own Part, if the world were certain of my Succeſſor, I ſhall never think my Affairs in Safety.</hi>

                  <p>We ſee here the very Conſiderations we are now on, of Declaring a Succeſſor, is in Debate by Embaſſador be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two great Queens, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99540:80"/>
                     <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> One the Head of the Proteſtants; the other of the Papiſts in their two Kingdoms. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the Lineal Heir to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the laſt Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; Queen <hi>Mary</hi> derived her ſelf to be the Collateral. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as it is before mentioned, had been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Illegitimate by the Pope and Popiſh Laws and Canons, and by her own Father; And a Popiſh Act of Parliament ſhe was not only Declared Illegitimate, but the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> her Mother to her Father, to be void; with the Penalty of High Treaſon, added on any who ſhould affirm Contrary to the firſt, or believe Contrary to the latter.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Therefore it is to be obſerved, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being a Proteſtant, thought it not wiſe or ſafe to Declare a Papiſt for her Succeſſor; yet ſhe after Declared King <hi>James</hi> her Son, who was a Proteſtant, her Succeſſor; and it pleaſed God to make him an Happy Inſtrument to Unite both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That ſhe being the Lineal Heir, thought it not wiſe or ſafe to Declare a Collateral Heir her Succeſſor in her own Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Therefore thought ſhe had a great Affection to make King <hi>James,</hi> who was her Godſon, her Succeſſor; yet ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to Declare him ſo, till on her Death-Bed ſhe perceived her ſelf paſt all hopes of having Lineal Heirs of her own Body; but while there was a poſſibility, ſhe might, ſhe Declared by 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. They ſhould be her Succeſſor, and Enacts a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of High Treaſon againſt thoſe who ſhould affirm the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> doth not think it fit that her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation ſhould be Judged by Popiſh Laws, as ſhe could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other would endeavour to be done, if ſhe permitted a Conteſt between her and a Papiſt. What? Shall a Virgin Queen be Judged by Laws, which, as is already ſhewn, came from the Prieſts of <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus?</hi> Shall a Proteſtant Queen be Judged and Shot to Death by the Cannons and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Strumpets <hi>Theodora Marozia,</hi> and the Whore of <hi>Babylon?</hi> No, ſhe was Judged Legitimate by the Holy Moral Law of God, and the Proteſtant Religion, to be Succeſſor to her Natural Father; and though he forſook her, God took
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99540:80"/>her up, and by his aſſiſtance the Gates of Hell were not able to prevail againſt the truth of the ſame: And let any Papiſt now, if he can, ſhew any Reaſon or Scripture, why he ſhould with foul mouth aſperſe the Legitimation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or the Kings Eldeſt Son; or why the latter ought not to be Succeſſor as well as was the former; and Print the ſame with his Name ſubſcribed: And no queſtion there are Proteſtants enough will anſwer him. Yea,<note place="margin">The Intereſt of a Prince Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate by the Moral Law of God and the Proteſtant Religion, to maintain both againſt Popiſh Ceremony and Superſtition.</note> let him prove, if he can, That 'tis not only the Greateſt Honour to a Proteſtant Prince himſelf, but a great Mercy and Providence of God to a Proteſtant People, to offer them ſuch a Prince whom he hath made Legitimate by his own Holy Law and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and permitted him to be Declared Illegitimate by the Papiſt unholy Law and Superſtition, and thereby laid on him the higheſt Obligation of his own Intereſt to maintain the Holy Moral Law of God and Proteſtant Religion, againſt the Popiſh Ceremonial Laws and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; and far worſe it had been for the Proteſtants, if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not been made Illegitimate by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, then that ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude, a full anſwer hath been therefore already given the Objection, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> never refuſed to Declare a Proteſtant and Lieal Succeſſor, but only ſuch as were either Papiſt or Collateral.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 7. <hi>A Proteſtant Succeſſor will not be equal to Papists, who are not only a Conſiderable, but a great and potent Party of the People of the Three Kingdoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

This is likewiſe anſwered in the following Reaſons, wherein it is ſhewn, That not only Proteſtants, but Papiſts themſelves (except Popiſh Prieſts) may hope for greater Security and Happineſs from a Proteſtant Succeſſor, than they ever had or 'tis poſſible for them to have from Papiſt Predeceſſors or Succeſſors; to which I therefore deſire to refer.</p>

Now therefore let it be ſhewn how theſe Papiſt Lords, being laid in the Pickle of Excommunication, and not having <hi>Perſonam ſtandi in Judicio,</hi> could have done to have bound the Conſcience of their Papiſt King, to have performed to them his Contract, Covenant, League, and Oath, or let it be no wonder if Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are very fearful to have a Succeſſor of ſuch a Religion; or if they think that theſe Lords had not been more happy if they had had a Proteſtant King, or of any Religion which would have bound his Conſcience to have kept his Word, and much more his Oath to his Subjects.</p>

                           <p>Another Article was, That no Juſtice could be expected from his hand; becauſe that contrary to the Oath he had taken when he was Crowned he had by Letters ſent into ſundry Shires, thereby procured certain Burgeſſes of the Parliament, &amp; Knights of the Shire to be Choſen, whom he knew would not fail to ſerve his turn, as occaſion ſhould be offered. Here we ſee is a Papiſt King, and Papiſt Subjects, and he takes an Oath to them concerning the greateſt Liberty the Subjects can enjoy; which is, the free Election of their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Parliament; yet this Papiſt King breaks this very. Oath, not only to his Papiſt Subjects, but to that very party who were of his own party, and Crowned him.</p>

                           <p>Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> a Friar Capuchin, was Born at <hi>Anxerre</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and was Brother of Monſieur <hi>Chateaude Boys,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> was Learned in the Languages, and of as great Diligence, Learning, Eloquence and blind Zeal in Preaching up the Papiſt Religion
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99540:91"/>as the beſt of them. And to ſpread the ſame, he Travelled to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and was there entertained at <hi>Bagnabar</hi> by the <hi>Chek,</hi> who had Married the eldeſt of the Princeſſes of <hi>Golconda,</hi> and he Promiſed to build him an Houſe, and a Church, gave him an Ox, and two Men to carry him to <hi>Maſlipatan,</hi> where he ſtayed to Imbark for <hi>Pegu,</hi> according to the order of his Superiours; but finding no Veſſel ready to ſet Sail, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> drew him to <hi>Madreſpatan,</hi> where they have a Fort called St. <hi>George,</hi> and a General Factory for every thing that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Countries of <hi>Golconda, Pegu,</hi> and <hi>Bengala;</hi> they over-perſwaded him that he might reap a fairer Harveſt in this place, than in any other part of the <hi>Indies;</hi> to which end they built him a very neat Houſe and a Church. <hi>Madreſpatan</hi> is but half a League from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a Sea-Town on the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> where was a very great Trade, eſpecially for Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, and a very great Number of Merchants and Workmen lived there, the greateſt part whereof deſired to Inhabit at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſpatan</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but that there was no Place for them to Exerciſe their Religion. But when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had Built a Church, and perſwaded Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> to ſtay, many of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> quitted St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> by reaſon of the frequent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and his great Care as well of the Natives, as of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and in regard he ſpoke both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Languages perfectly well, which cauſed ſo great Envy in the Clergy of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Church, that they reſolved to ruin him, and laid their Plot thus. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> being ſo near Neighbours, could not chooſe but have ſeveral Quarrels one with another; and ſtill Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> who was in great Reputation with both, was applied to for Compoſing their Differences.</p>
                           <p>Now one day, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> quarrelled on purpoſe with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marriners that were in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Road, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came by the worſt: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preſident reſolving to have Satisfaction for the Injury, a War brake out between the two Nations, which had Ruin'd all the Trade of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, had not the Merchants on both ſide been very diligent to bring things to an Accommodation, not knowing any thing of the wicked contrivance of particular perſons againſt Father <hi>Ephraim.</hi> All the Interpoſition of Merchants availed nothing, the Friar muſt be concerned in the Affair, he muſt be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99540:92"/>to Act between Party and Party, which he readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                           <p>But he was no ſooner entred into St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but he was ſeized by Ten or Twelve Officers of the Inquiſition, who ſhipt him away in a Frigat that was bound at the ſame time for <hi>Goa.</hi> They fetter'd and manacled him, and kept him Two and twenty Days at Sea, before they would once let him put his foot on ſhoar, though the beſt part of the Marriners, lay aſhoar every Night: When they came to <hi>Goa,</hi> they ſtayed till Night before they would Land Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to carry him to the Inquiſition-Houſe; for they were afraid if they ſhould Land him in the Day, the People ſhould know of it and Riſe in Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue of a Perſon who was in Veneration over all <hi>India.</hi>

                           <p>The News was preſently ſpread abroad in all Parts, that Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> was in the Inquiſition, which very much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed all the <hi>Frenchmen;</hi> but he who was moſt ſurprized and troubled at it was Friar <hi>Zenon</hi> the Capuchin, who had been formerly Father <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Companion; who after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his Friends, reſolved to go to <hi>Goa,</hi> though he were put into the Inquiſition himſelf; for when a Man is once ſhut up there, if any one have the boldneſs to ſpeak to the Inquiſitor, or to any of his Counſel in his behalf, he is preſently put into the Inquiſition alſo, and accounted a greater Offender than the other; neither the Archbiſhop nor Vice-Roy themſelves dare Interpoſe, though they are the only two Perſons over whom the Inquiſition hath no Power; for if they do any thing to offend them, they preſently write to the Inquiſitor General and his Counſel in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and as the King and the Inquiſitor General Commands, they either proceed againſt, or ſend theſe two great Perſons into <hi>Portugal.</hi>

Monſieur <hi>de Chateau Des Boys,</hi> Father <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Brother complained to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſador, who preſently wrote to the King his Maſter to ſend a Poſitive Command by his firſt Ship thither, that Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould be Diſcharged; The Pope himſelf alſo

And if an <hi>Indian</hi> King had not relieved him more than the Pope or King of <hi>Portugal</hi> were able to do, he had been there Deſtroyed; for the King of <hi>Colconda,</hi> who was at Wars with the <hi>Raga</hi> of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> and his Army lay round about St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> on Complaint to him of the Injuſtice by the Inquiſition to Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſent order to his General <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimola</hi> to lay Siege to the Town, and put all to Fire and Sword unleſs the Governor would make him a firm Promiſe that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould be ſet at Liberty within two Months; which ſo allarm'd the Governor and Town, that they ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got him to be ſet at Liberty at <hi>Goa.

If a Papiſt Succeſſor happen, all Lay-Papiſts living within the four Sees, will be Compell'd to proſtitute their Wives and Daughters, to the Prieſt in Auricular Confeſſions, to have their Nakedneſs diſcovered, their Eſtates purloined, the Secrets of their Houſes, and oftentimes their Lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to their Enemies, and they ſhall be compelled to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the falſe Certificate of the Inſolent Prieſt to diſinherit their True and Natural Children, and Heirs, and to appoint falſe and adulterous Heirs, and <hi>fils de Preſtre</hi> to Succeed to their Inheritances, and no Probation ſhall be admitted to the Contrary, from which more than <hi>Pagan</hi> ſlavery, a Proteſtant Succeſſor will free them; but never a Papiſt.</p>

And not long after, the Cardinal ſent Two of his Hangmen to him in Priſon, where he was ſpending his time in Prayer, one of whom put upon him a Coat of Black Linnen Cloath, and the other tyed about all Parts of his Body many little Bags of Gun-Powder, and cloathed with theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, they bring him out of his Lodgings, to an outer Room, near the Gate of the Caſtle, and there commanded him to ſtay till he was ſent for: Then the Fire was made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Stake at the Weſt end of the Caſtle near to the Priory, over againſt the place of Execution, the Caſtle Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were hung with rich Hangings, and Velvet Cuſhions, laid for the Cardinal and Prelats, who from thence did feed their Eyes with the Torments of this Innocent Man.

To whom Mr. <hi>Wiſchard</hi> anſwered, <hi>The fire Torments my Body, but no way abates my Spirit.</hi> And then looking towards the Cardinal, ſaid, <hi>He who in ſuch ſtate, from that High place, feedeth his eyes with my Torments, within few Days ſhall be Hanged out at the ſame Window, to be ſeen with as much Ignominy, as he now leaneth there in Pride.</hi> Then with

                           <hi>Dan. Hist.</hi> 174. It were infinite to recite all the Buyers and Sellers of Succeſſions to Kingdoms, there having rarely been any Age or Nation wherein the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Churches and Kingdoms hath not been alike common, either by the Prieſt, Nobles, or Souldiers, and corrupted both the Divinity and Juſtice of both, except where an Houſe of Commons hath had an hand in the Actual declaring the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; when therefore a Succeſſor is not declared by Act of Parliament, but left to buy his Right, theſe horrible Miſchiefs enſue. Firſt, To the Prince himſelf. Secondly, To the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As to the Prince himſelf, theſe Miſchiefs enſue.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) If to buy a Kingdom he is known to give Donatives or Penſions, he raiſes a greater Party againſt him than he can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige for him; for if he give a Donative or Penſion to one, he can oblige only that one; but for him diſobliges an hundred.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) No Perſon that receives a Bribe can be obliged by that Bribe, becauſe what he doth is for Money, and not for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and if any offer him another Bribe, he will as readily be for the laſt giver, as he was for the firſt; for the firſt giver of Money cannot take his Gift from him again: And the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99540:112"/>if he hath but half ſo much giver by the ſecond giver as the firſt, will think he ſhall be richer with a Gift and half, than only with a ſingle Gift. Hence it is that,</p>

                        <p>And the <hi>Roman</hi> Mercenaries who were corrupted with great Donatives by one Emperor, before he was ſcarce warm in his ſeat, uſed to kill him, and if a new offered another Donative, ſet up him for the like time, till another offered them a new Donative. And ſo they perpetually Murdered them from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation. It's true, many good Princes have been compelled to buy their Rights; and better it were they did ſo, than the ſame ſhould be taken from them by one that hath no Right; but this can only be underſtood where there is a Neceſſity, and no Remedy: But where God is pleaſed to offer a juſt King, and a juſt Parliament to Judge equally, there is no Neceſſity of uſing any unjuſt means, though to obtain Right.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) If a Prince buy not with ready Money, or Donatives given in Poſſeſſion, but oblige himſelf in future Promiſes, if he obtain the Kingdom, the Mercenaries are ſo many who will expect to be promiſed, and their Nature ſo unſatiable, That no Prince can be ſo rich who is to obtain, nor can any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be ſo rich when it is obtained, as to be able to ſatisfie a ſmall part of them, and who fail of their Expectation turn Enemies. As <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. promiſed the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> if he obtained the Kingdom, very great Rewards; but after he was King failed to perform the ſame, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Mortal Enemy, and King <hi>Richard</hi> paid his Promiſes by cutting him off for Treaſon, when he had firſt ruined <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> by laying the Plot for <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) If the Kingdoms are left expoſed to Sale, a Papiſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor will be richer than a Proteſtant; and ſo carry it by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, though not by Right.</p>
